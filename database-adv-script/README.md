# Joins and Subqueries

This directory contains SQL scripts demonstrating advanced JOIN and SUBQUERY queries
on an Airbnb-like database schema.

## Files

- `joins_queries.sql`: Contains three queries illustrating the use of `INNER JOIN`,
  `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`, each ordered for consistent output.
- `subqueries.sql`: Contains two queries illustrating the use of non-correlated and correlated subqueries.

## Usage

1. Open the SQL script (`joins_queries.sql` or `subqueries.sql`) in your preferred SQL client.
2. Ensure that the relevant tables (`users`, `bookings`, `properties`, `reviews`) exist
   with appropriate primary and foreign keys.
3. Execute the script to view the results.
