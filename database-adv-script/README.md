# Advanced SQL Scripts

This directory contains SQL scripts demonstrating advanced SQL concepts on
an Airbnb-like database schema.

## Files

- `joins_queries.sql`: Demonstrates `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` with ordering.
- `subqueries.sql`: Demonstrates non-correlated and correlated subqueries for analytical filtering.
- `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`: Demonstrates aggregation (`COUNT`, `GROUP BY`) and window functions (`RANK`).

## Usage

1. Open the SQL script (`joins_queries.sql`, `subqueries.sql`, or `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`) in your preferred SQL client.
2. Ensure that the relevant tables (`users`, `bookings`, `properties`, `reviews`) exist with
the appropriate primary and foreign keys.
3. Execute the script to view and analyze the results.
