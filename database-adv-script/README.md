# Joins Queries

This directory contains SQL scripts demonstrating advanced JOIN queries
on an Airbnb-like database schema.

## Files

- `joins_queries.sql`: Contains three queries illustrating the use of `INNER JOIN`,
  `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

## Usage

1. Open the `joins_queries.sql` script in your preferred SQL client.
2. Ensure that the `users`, `bookings`, `properties`, and `reviews` tables exist
   with appropriate primary and foreign keys.
3. Execute the script to view the join results.
